# Streamlit Dashboard for Plant Health Monitoring

This dashboard is designed to provide real-time visualisations of the data collected from the Liverpool Natural History Museum's conservatory plant sensors. The sensors capture various environmental factors, such as soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, which are then processed and visualised on this dashboard.

The dashboard will allow stakeholders to:

- Monitor short-term data (last 24 hours) stored in the RDS instance.
- Access long-term archived data stored in an S3 bucket.
- View graphs and insights on the health of individual plants, helping the museum's gardening team take prompt action when required.

The dashboard is built using Streamlit, which enables interactive and responsive visualisations for users to track plant health trends and spot any potential issues early.
